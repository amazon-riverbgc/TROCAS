We are asking fundamental questions about the lower Amazon River and the inner plume that are critical to our understanding of carbon cycling in all fluvial systems. Our working premise is that the equilibrium between greenhouse gas (GHG) inputs and outputs along the lower river and inner plume is regulated by hydrology, driving the input of organic matter and gases from the landscape, and hydrodynamics, which exerts a primary control on in situ respiration, primary production, and gas exchange rates.
