The TROCAS Data Browser is intended to provide convenient overviews and exploration of TROCAS data. It aggregates sensor data from the TROCAS project across all TROCAS transects conducted so far and collected from a boat in continuous “underway” mode while transiting or remaining stationary at a location. Sensor types currently included are EXO Sonde, Licor CO2, Picarro and GPS. It does not yet include ADCP dataq or data from experiments or from laboratory analyses of samples.
