## TROCAS Missing-Data Inventory 

### TR 8
- 2020-1-18: EXO Sonde data was exported in a format that's different from EXO Sonde files from all other TROCAS: in csv rather than Excel format; header rows are organized very differently. We need the .bin files to then use the Sonde software to re-export to the Excel format.
- Picarro data was not collected
