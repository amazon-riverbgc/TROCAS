**From Obidos to the Ocean**

TROCAS (Trocas Líquidas de Carbono do Ecossistema do Baixo Rio Amazonas: Da Terra para o Oceano e Atmosfera; Net Ecosystem Exchange of the Lower Amazon: from Land to the Ocean and Atmosphere) seeks to unravel the sequence of processes and source(s) of terrestrially-derived organic matter (OM) that culminate in the immense CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing to the atmosphere from tropical rivers worldwide, with an immediate focus on the lower Amazon River.  We ask, what are the sources and magnitudes of carbon of terrestrial origin, by fraction, relative to aquatic sources from phytoplankton and macrophytes, in the different sectors of the river system? How much carbon is discharged to the ocean, relative to the atmosphere?

The Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura (CENA, Piracicaba) and the University of Washington (UW, Seattle) are the lead institutions. Partners in the Amazon include the Universidade Federal do Amapá (UNIFAP, Macapá), the Universidade do Estado do Amapá (UEAP, Macapá), the Universidade Federal do Oeste do Pará (UFOPA, Santarém), and the Universidade Federal Rural da Amazônia (UFRA). Outside of the Amazon, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE, Sao José dos Campos) and the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (COPPE/UFRJ, Rio).

TROCAS is funded by the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP, the science-funding organization of the State of São Paulo), through their  "São Paulo Excellence Chair (SPEC)" thematic program, and the Universidade de São Paulo, and by the NSF Ecosystem Studies program.


*From NSF proposal summary:*

**Overview.** The research objective is to examine, at different scales, the processes that govern the
advection and reaction of carbon in the lowest reach of the Amazon River and along the near-shore
coastline of the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The main stem of the river is a large supplier of carbon
dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere, most of which is sourced as organic carbon from the surrounding
landscape and subsequently remineralized in river. The component of the river system that is least well
understood is the tidal reach, which consists of two main channels each three times the girth of the
Mississippi River at its widest point. While tidal forcing does not result in salt intrusion, riverine flow in
this reach can be reversed, and complex interactions occur between the river channels and the fringe
areas, making the study of this component of the world’s largest river a significant logistical challenge.

Preliminary measurements completed by an international team from seven universities suggest that
fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere remain high out to the freshwater terminus located ~60km offshore from
the river mouth. Aside from these initial surveys, no systematic measurements have ever been made in the
lower reach. Considering the vast amount of surface area this region encompasses, its evaluation will
significantly increase global estimates of aquatic CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing and help complete global carbon flux
estimates. Likewise, there is little mechanistic understanding of the biological and physiochemical
processes that control carbon cycling in this transition zone. The proposed study will the examine river
dynamics within a net ecosystem exchange (NEE) framework. Two primary questions will be addressed:
1. what are the geographic and temporal distributions and magnitudes of riverine CO<sub>2</sub> production
(system-scale)
2. what are the dynamics that drive and control outgassing (microbial-scale)?

**Intellectual Merit.** Rivers are significant to the global carbon cycle because they modulate carbon
dynamics not only in their watersheds but also in their marine receiving waters. Global estimates of CO<sub>2</sub>
flux from inland waters to the atmosphere have increased significantly in the last decade as observations
have become more widespread. However, data coverage is still sparse in remote locations such as large
tropical rivers, which contribute disproportionately to CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing compared to temperate and high-
latitude systems. The proposed study builds upon ~8 years of work in the lower Amazon River from
Óbidos to the city of Macapá. These initial studies revealed that the tidal reaches of large rivers and the
inner transition zone between fresh and saline waters represent significant gaps in global data coverage.

Through an ambitious field study the project aims to understand the large-scale drivers (e.g.
hydrodynamics, areal extent, metabolism) that create the spatial and temporal variability in carbon
remineralization and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in the lower river. This will be addressed this using a combination of
field work and modeling. In addition, the types of organic matter that are degraded, the microorganisms
and consortia that remineralize, and the metabolic pathways (aerobic, anaerobic) that lead to the large
production of CO<sub>2</sub> will be evaluated this using a combination of organic geochemical and molecular
biological (proteomic) tools. The proposed work will provide in situ observations in a previously
unstudied region of high global importance, experimentation focused on unraveling the influence of
physical factors (e.g. tides, current velocity, and mixing) on biological processes, and modeling tools
capable of predicting the sensitivity of NEE.

**Broader Impacts.** The proposed research will have broader impacts in five arenas:
1. The project will contribute to understanding the dynamics of large rivers in the global carbon cycle.
2. The project will continue its capacity building of Brazilian students and institutions in the Amazon and São Paulo. The engagement of US and Brazilian students and Post-Docs working jointly is a model for how global geosciences can evolve. 
3. Data and models will be available to contribute to analyzing the major resource issues facing the Amazon—not only longer-term climate change, but immediate land-use and development issues including agriculture and dams.
4. The project will advance the development of the Dynamic Information Framework, a construct being developed jointly with the World Bank to address sustainability and policy issues in South America, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa.
5. Underrepresented students at the University of Washington Program on the Environment will be involved in local data analysis and lab work.
