# TROCAS Data

Describe what this section will be about.

<!-- Regarding data, I think this section should not aim to describe all the data and analyses carried out in TROCAS. That should be done in a different section under "Project".
Instead, this section should address issues of data file/object storage, management, access, and computation -->

- Data produced
  - on S3 (parquet). Include the AWS bucket name, links to current parquet files (but not intended to be exhaustive), and info about requesting access (first confirm it's not currently set to anonymous, public access)
  - on Google Drive
- Data tools & products (software, including Jupyter Notebooks)
  - TROCAS data browser
  - Scripts to process underway sensor raw files
  - Scripts to create merged 1-minute binned files
- Mention Team Access page for access to private-access data; link to it
